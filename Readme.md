Certainly! Here's a README file to help you run the Python application using Docker:

# Running the Python Application with Docker

This guide will walk you through the process of building a Docker image and running a Python application using FastAPI, which interacts with a Microsoft SQL Server database using PyODBC. The application is containerized for easy deployment and scaling.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose (usually included with Docker Desktop on Windows and Docker for Mac)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the application's source code from your version control system or download it as a zip archive and extract it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

## Step 2: Update Connection String

Edit the `app.py` file to update the `connection_string` variable with the appropriate connection details for your SQL Server database.

## Step 3: Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-python-app .
```

Replace `my-python-app` with a suitable name for your Docker image.

## Step 4: Run the Docker Container

After successfully building the Docker image, you can run the application in a Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 my-python-app
```

Replace `my-python-app` with the name you provided in step 3.

The `-p 8000:8000` option maps port 8000 on your host machine to the container's port 8000. You can change the host port if needed.

## Step 5: Access the Application

Your Python application is now running in a Docker container. You can access it by opening a web browser or sending HTTP requests to `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

- `/tasks`: List all tasks (GET)
- `/tasks/{task_id}`: Retrieve a single task by ID (GET)
- `/tasks`: Create a new task (POST)
- `/tasks/{task_id}`: Update an existing task by ID (PUT)
- `/tasks/{task_id}`: Delete a task by ID (DELETE)

## Cleaning Up

To stop and remove the Docker container, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the container is running. Then, remove the container with:

```bash
docker rm -f <container_id>
```

Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID, which you can obtain from `docker ps`.

## Conclusion

You've successfully built and run a Python application using Docker. Feel free to make changes to the application, rebuild the Docker image, and deploy it to your preferred environment.
